Peachy Productions Notes

thread rod diameter 9.4mm
disks should not overlap if made bigger
disks could have lines to show alignment -> rotation detection could look for both aligned
marked print area (off-centre of disk)
labelled button panel

print area should be cube -> disk pin distance is treadWidth*2/sqrt(2) -> disk radius is treadWidth (lol)

made a few days ago, mostly assembled.
sacrificed cubeness of build volume for a smaller physical size. track width is largest dimension, and slightly larger tall dimension than the left-right dimension.
